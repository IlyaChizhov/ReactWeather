## A simple pet-project showing the weather outside and created to get to know the React, Redux and React-router.

Functional:
- User's welcome or login page (if the first time they visit the site);
- The weather panel (wind speed, temperature, humidity, description and street) is provided by https://openweathermap.org/
- The background picture changes depending on the weather.

P.S:
- You should complete the processing of the user's refusing in the definition of geolocation;
- Write prop-types;
- Make the magic button "move" which will change the weather at least in this application =)
